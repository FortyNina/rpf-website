            Red Planet Farming is an educational strategy game that puts players in the
            shoes of the first Agricultural Director on Mars. Equipped with futuristic
            technology, players must grow enough food to feed and sustain a Martian colony—a
            task that pits them against dust storms, radiation, and other harsh climate conditions on Mars.
