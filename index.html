       <h2>ABOUT THE GAME</h2>
        <p>
            Red Planet Farming is an educational strategy game that puts players in the
            shoes of the first Agricultural Director on Mars. Equipped with futuristic
            technology, players must grow enough food to feed and sustain a Martian colonyâ€”a
            task that pits them against dust storms, radiation, and other harsh climate conditions on Mars.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Red Planet Farming, we aim to give players a better understanding of not only Mars, but
          the technology that will be used to one day sustain life there. The game familiarizes its players
           with common hazards and obstacles that future generations could face on Mars, like dust storms,
           radiation, and even Marsquakes. It also gives players a general understanding of futuristic
            tech like high-powered domes, grow lights, and radiation covers. Ultimately we want to get
            people excited about the next stages of space travel and the thrilling aspect of brining
            life to another planet.
