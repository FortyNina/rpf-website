            The Interplanetary Department of Agriculture is looking for a new Director of Agriculture

       <h2 class = "secondaryTitle">ABOUT THE GAME</h2>
        <p class="bodyText">
            Red Planet Farming is an educational strategy game that puts players in the
            shoes of the first Agricultural Director on Mars. Equipped with futuristic
            technology, players must grow enough food to feed and sustain a Martian colonyâ€”a
            task that pits them against dust storms, radiation, and other harsh climate conditions on Mars.
        </p>
        
        <p class="bodyText">
            Red Planet Farming has been in development since January 2019 and is the recipient of
            the 2019 NYU &amp Sloan Foundation Games Production grant.
